# Adafruit GFX Library ![Build Status](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library/workflows/Arduino%20Library%20CI/badge.svg)

This is the core graphics library for all our displays, providing a common set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.). It needs to be paired with a hardware-specific library for each display device we carry (to handle the lower-level functions).
